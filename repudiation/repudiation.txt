1. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

In the insecure version, there is no logging mechanism to record user actions, making it difficult to trace who performed what actions and when. 
This lack of audit trails allows users or attackers to repudiate their activities. 
The secure version addresses this by implementing logging, where each action, such as sending a message or accessing messages, is logged with a timestamp and the user's information. 
This creates an audit trail that can be used to verify and trace user actions, thereby preventing repudiation

2. What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

one mechanism is to implement detailed audit trails that log all user actions, including successful and failed attempts to access resources, changes made, and the time of these actions.
So, we conduct regular audits of the logs to detect unauthorized or suspicious activities and to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the logs.
