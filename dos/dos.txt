1. Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

A DoS vulnerability occurs when an attacker overwhelms a system with requests, causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate traffic. 
Although the provided code examples don't directly illustrate a classic DoS attack vulnerability, inefficient handling of database queries and unhandled exceptions can contribute to system overload and potential DoS conditions. 
In the secure version, using a try/catch block helps in properly handling exceptions that might occur during database operations, which can prevent the server from crashing on unexpected errors. 
However, to specifically prevent DoS attacks, more robust measures are needed, such as rate limiting or request validation.

2. What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

one mechanism is to implement rate limiting on your server to control the number of requests a user can make in a certain timeframe, preventing overloading of the system.
